= Formatting

Lisp is hard to format.
https://aartaka.me/lisp-indent.html[] is a great read on this.

There are two main ways to format someting.

[,clojure]
----
(myfn arg1
      arg2
      arg3)

(myfn
  arg1
  arg2
  arg3)
----

Some people mix both, I prefer to always use two space indentation.
Either way, a lot of the time it gives me mixed feelings on the result.

== Readability

One thing I've noticed is that Lisps (in general)
are much harder to quickly scan through than other languages.

The main reason being that a Lisp, being a Lisp, has a very regular syntax.
This means that important language constructs, such as control flow,
look exactly the same as things like function calls.

While scanning code, this makes them harder to be distinguished.

= Toolchain

Zig has no official LSP server but https://github.com/zigtools/zls[ZLS],
an unofficial community maintained server can be used.

https://github.com/marler8997/anyzig[anyzig] is a tool which automatically
installs and proxies calls to Zig.
As of writing (2025-12-06) it does not work with the VSCode extension
footnote:[tracking issue: https://github.com/marler8997/anyzig/issues/29].

`zig-fmt` isn't the greatest formatter.
One issue is that it doesn't have a sense of too long lines,
so it will often generate extremely long, unreadable anonymous structs.
The fix is to manually append a trailing comma
which will force it into multiline mode.

// fix
foo(.{

  .quux = false, // trailing comma
});
